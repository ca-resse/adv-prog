"UserDetails.json" is used to store admin and survey creator UserDetails
"StudentLogins.json" is used to store student UserDetails

"currentStudent.txt" is only used to pass the Student's ID across two different screens as it is needed

For every screen, there is an "invalid" variant of it just to show the corresponding error prompt (I'm sorry)
